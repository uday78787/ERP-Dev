# Manufacturing Workflows

## 1. Common command rules

Every command validates authenticated actor, permission, company/site scope, current state, referenced revision, quantities/UOM, and idempotency. UI validation is advisory; the backend and database enforce invariants. A committed posting is immutable. Corrections use linked reversal/adjustment workflows. Each material transition records actor, timestamp, reason where required, correlation/idempotency key, audit record, and outbox event in the same transaction.

Statuses below are initial proposals. Configure exact states and transition authority during discovery; do not permit arbitrary status updates.

## 2. Dependency chain

```text
Platform/security + company scope
  -> master data and UOM
  -> product/variant + approved BOM/routing
  -> customer order or MTS plan -> demand
  -> inventory/procurement visibility -> MRP and capacity plan
  -> approved/released work order
  -> job cards + reservations/issues + WIP movements
  -> production confirmations + inspection/disposition
  -> accepted finished goods -> packing -> authorized dispatch
  -> costing/reporting and reconciliation
```

Email, MES, and reporting subscribe to committed events/queries. They do not bypass the owning workflow. This dependency chain determines the implementation order in the roadmap.

## 3. Customer/buyer order to demand

1. Maintain customer, buyer, contact, commercial terms, product/style, and active variant/size/color attributes.
2. Capture buyer PO reference and date. Create a Sales Order with line quantities/UOM, price/currency, and delivery schedules.
3. Validate customer/variant scope, duplicate references, quantity/price precision, delivery date, and order-specific constraints.
4. Save as Draft; submit for approval according to policy. Store approval against the exact order revision; requester self-approval is blocked where required.
5. Reject with a reason or approve. Confirmation freezes the revision for normal edits.
6. Amend a confirmed order only through a numbered amendment, impact analysis, approval, and history of before/after values. Recalculate affected demand explicitly.
7. Create one idempotent MTO demand source per confirmed line/schedule. It is not proof of available material or completed production.
8. MTS demand originates from approved forecast/replenishment policy and carries a distinct source type; do not count it as a customer order.

## 4. Product engineering and apparel data

1. Maintain common items, stocking/purchase UOM, controlled conversion, category, tracking policy, and status.
2. Apparel product/style defines governed season, size/color axes, product variants, and customer/brand references as required.
3. Author a BOM with fabric, trims, accessories, and packaging; define standard consumption, waste, UOM, alternatives, and effective dates.
4. Author routing operations for configured cutting, sewing, finishing, washing, print, embroidery, packing, or other processes. Identify internal vs subcontract operations.
5. Validate structure, cycles, UOM dimensions, effective dates, and required components. Submit and approve an immutable BOM/routing version.
6. A released work order stores its exact versions and a material/operation snapshot. Later engineering changes create new versions, not retroactive edits.

## 5. MRP and production planning

1. Select an as-of time, planning horizon, company/site, and eligible demand set.
2. Explode each demand through its approved effective BOM snapshot, including variant-specific components, wastage, and lead-time offsets.
3. Calculate gross requirements, eligible on-hand, active reservations/allocations, open supply by expected date, and net shortage. Exclude quarantine/rejected stock and supplier custody from ordinary availability.
4. Persist the run inputs/version and calculation explanation. A rerun creates a new run instead of erasing prior results.
5. Produce order-wise material shortages, earliest availability dates, and purchase suggestions. Users review and approve requisitions; MRP never places a PO automatically.
6. Capacity planning allocates line/work center, operation, machine capability, shifts, target, priority, and date windows. Record schedule revisions and bottlenecks.
7. Flag infeasible schedules and missing material; do not mark planned quantity as available production capacity without resource calendars and assumptions.

## 6. Procurement and receiving

Proposed lifecycle:

```text
Requisition Draft -> Submitted -> Pending Approval -> Approved/Rejected
-> RFQ/Quotation (optional) -> PO Draft -> Pending Approval -> Issued
-> Partially Received -> Received/Closed
```

- Link requisition lines to shortage/demand and PO lines back to requisitions where applicable.
- PO records supplier commitment, ordered UOM/quantity, conversion, price/currency, and promised date. Issuing a PO changes no stock.
- Receive actual quantity against PO lines; partial delivery is supported. Excess beyond configured tolerance requires authorization.
- Create lot/receipt records and inspection requirements. Disposition separately identifies accepted, held/quarantined, rejected, and returned quantity.
- Post accepted/restricted stock movements only through the inventory posting boundary. Supplier invoice references do not substitute for receipt.

## 7. Inventory and warehouse transactions

Availability is calculated by company/site/item/location/bin/lot/status from posted movements less active reservations/allocations. Make on-hand, available, reserved, allocated, in-transit, quarantine, rejected, WIP, finished goods, and subcontractor custody distinguishable.

- **Receipt:** post actual received quantity with source/lot/status; inspection governs eligibility.
- **Reservation:** allocate eligible quantity to demand/work order; does not change physical on-hand.
- **Issue:** check released work order, required item/remaining need, authorized location, eligibility, reservation policy, UOM conversion, and idempotency; append linked movement.
- **Return/consumption/scrap:** separate commands; issued is not equivalent to consumed.
- **Transfer:** validate source and destination; record dispatch, in-transit, and destination receipt if two-step transfer is required. Preserve lot/status.
- **Count/adjustment:** require count authority, reason, variance approval policy, and linked ledger posting. Never set balance directly.
- Prevent negative eligible stock by default. Any exception requires an explicit scoped policy, authorization, and audit.

## 8. Work order, job cards, and material issue

Proposed lifecycle:

```text
Draft -> Pending Approval -> Approved -> Released -> In Progress
-> Partially Completed -> Completed -> Closed
```

Hold, resume, cancel, and controlled quantity revision are explicit transitions.

1. Create a work order linked to demand allocation, product/variant, approved BOM/routing snapshot, planned quantity, site, and production/delivery dates.
2. Check duplicate demand allocation, engineering validity, schedule/resource feasibility, authorization, and configured material policy.
3. Release only after required approvals and snapshot records are committed. A work order retains exact engineering versions.
4. Generate job cards by operation and planned quantity. Assign line/machine/shift/team as applicable.
5. Reserve or issue materials against the work order/job card under configured policy; allow partial issue. Record issue separately from consumption.
6. Track quantities remaining at every operation; do not release an operation before its prerequisite and input quantity are reconciled.
7. Hold/cancel/close requires validated reason and checks for outstanding material, WIP, quality, and child job cards.

## 9. Production confirmation and quality

1. Record confirmation against a released work order/job card/operation using a unique idempotency key.
2. Capture good, rejected, rework, scrap quantities, shift/team/line/machine, actual start/end, downtime, remarks, and supervisor where applicable.
3. Validate against assigned/input/remaining quantity and operation prerequisites. Repeated request with the same key returns the original result, not a duplicate posting.
4. Reported output is not automatically accepted output. Create inspection subject and hold controlled output pending required checks.
5. Incoming, inline, end-line, final, and finished-goods inspection record plan/sample, defect, severity, inspector, and disposition.
6. Disposition moves quantities to accepted/next-operation, hold, rework, or rejection; totals reconcile to inspected/produced quantities.
7. Rework is linked to original defect/output, authorized quantity, and a defined rework route. Rework cannot re-enter indefinitely or be counted twice as good.
8. Finished-goods receipt is permitted only for completed, quality-released output and creates a traceable stock movement.

## 10. Job work and subcontracting

```text
Draft -> Approved -> Material/WIP Dispatched -> Partially Received
-> Reconciled -> Quality Released -> Closed
```

1. Create job-work order from an outsourced routing operation; assign supplier, expected return date, quantities, and charge basis.
2. Dispatch company-owned material/WIP through a custody movement and document. It is not available warehouse stock while at supplier.
3. Record partial processed returns, good/rework/reject quantities, material consumed/returned/scrapped, and supplier charges.
4. Inspect the returned output where required; post eligible inventory only after disposition.
5. Reconcile issued, processed, returned, consumed, rejected, and outstanding quantities before closure. Unexplained variance requires resolution/approval.

## 11. Maintenance and workforce

- Maintenance request identifies machine, severity, downtime, line impact, and reporter; approval/assignment creates maintenance work.
- Record preventive plan, technician, checks, parts issued, cause, corrective/preventive action, cost, approval, and completion time.
- Link downtime to line/capacity and production performance without rewriting confirmed production.
- Manage employee, skill/qualification, training, shift, attendance, leave, and team assignments under privacy permissions.
- Production may reference a qualified team/lead/shift. Do not require one employee per produced unit unless an approved business rule demands it.

## 12. Finished goods, packing, and dispatch

```text
Produced Pending Inspection -> Quality Released -> Available
-> Picked -> Packed -> Dispatch Authorized -> Dispatched -> Delivered
```

1. Receive eligible finished output by order, variant, lot, and warehouse.
2. Allocate pick quantity to a Sales Order line only from eligible available stock and within remaining order quantity.
3. Pack by size/color/variant into cartons with unique IDs; reconcile carton contents to picked quantity.
4. Authorize dispatch after checks for order status, remaining demand, packed quantity, quality status, stock, documents, and permission.
5. Support partial dispatch. Record dispatch documents, transporter/vehicle/tracking, actual time, and delivery confirmation as separate events.
6. Never allow dispatch beyond packed, eligible available stock or remaining authorized quantity. Delivery confirmation is not inferred from dispatch.

## 13. Finance, notifications, MES, and reporting

- Cost entries link procurement price, FIFO allocation if selected, material consumption, labor/time, machine, subcontract charge, scrap, and output. Variance is explained, not silently balanced.
- Accounting/tax postings are a separate integration/release scope. Configuration for a jurisdiction is not a compliance claim.
- Commit in-app/email notifications through an outbox after the business transaction; track attempts, retry, permanent failure, and user preferences.
- MES messages use versioned contracts, authenticated endpoints, idempotency, bounded retries, integration logs, and reconciliation. ERP validations remain mandatory.
- Reports read persisted transactional data or rebuildable read models, enforce authorization, show as-of/filter context, and define calculations. Exports are permission controlled and logged.

## 14. Reconciliation checkpoints

Expose, rather than hide, differences between: ordered/demanded/allocated; gross/available/reserved/scheduled material; PO/received/accepted/rejected quantities; issued/returned/consumed/scrapped materials; operation input/output/reject/rework; subcontractor custody; inspected/accepted/held output; finished goods/packed/dispatched/delivered quantities; and inventory ledger/projection/FIFO value.
