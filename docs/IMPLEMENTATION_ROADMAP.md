# Manufacturing ERP Implementation Roadmap

## 1. Delivery principles

Deliver one bounded, end-to-end capability at a time. Every slice includes domain invariants, schema/migration, API/application use case, permission and scope enforcement, usable frontend workflow when applicable, audit/history, focused tests, documentation, and observable failure behavior.

Do not build all modules before an operational vertical slice. Do not treat a navigation menu, mock data, or generated schema as delivered business functionality. Keep the frontend, API, and database running locally during early development; decide production topology separately.

## 2. Prerequisites and cross-cutting foundations

**Before application implementation:**

- Confirm target company/site model, first apparel flow, first user roles/approvals, identity provider, local database strategy, backup ownership, privacy boundaries, and valuation/UOM decisions.
- Approve the stack and local port/configuration conventions.
- Create repository setup, dependency/version policy, secret handling, local run instructions, CI, coding standards, and a minimal threat model.

**Shared prerequisites for all modules:**

- Authentication/session, authorization policy and company/site scope.
- Error/validation contracts, structured logging/correlation, time and numeric policies.
- Database migration discipline and integration-test infrastructure.
- Audit/history, document numbering, idempotency, transaction boundaries, outbox contract.
- Common master data and controlled UOM conversions.

These are platform capabilities, not permission to build every module up front.

## 3. Phases and exit gates

### Phase 0 — Product discovery and architecture review

Deliver reviewed requirements, module boundaries, data relationships, workflow maps, assumptions, security boundaries, and decisions list.

**Gate:** owner approves first operational workflow, platform/database/auth choices, local runtime expectations, and unresolved policies are recorded.

### Phase 1 — Local developer foundation and secure access

Create backend solution/layers, frontend shell/project, PostgreSQL local-development setup guidance, health endpoints, configuration/secret handling, test projects, and reproducible local run scripts. Implement login/logout with the selected identity approach, secure server-side session/cookies, CSRF, user provisioning, and an initial administrator path.

**Gate:** both app processes start locally; database migration/connection succeeds; login/logout and session expiry work; unauthenticated/forbidden requests are tested; no development auth bypass or checked-in secrets.

### Phase 2 — Platform scope and master data

Implement company/site scope, role/permission assignment and approval primitives; UOM/conversion, customer, supplier, item/category, warehouse/bin, operation/shift, and basic equipment references. Add controlled search/filter/paging and audit.

**Gate:** database enforces scoped uniqueness/references; authorization and validation tests pass; referenced masters cannot be destructively deleted.

### Phase 3 — Product engineering and first industry pack

Implement product/style and variants, normalized size/color dimensions, versioned BOM and routing, effective dates, review/approval, and snapshots. Configure the initial apparel operations/material categories.

**Gate:** version/effectivity, BOM explosion/rounding, variant identity, approval and snapshot behavior tested; no apparel-only assumption is required by core.

### Phase 4 — Sales order and demand

Implement buyer PO, Sales Order lines/delivery schedules, approval/rejection/amendment, status history, confirmed MTO demand, and MTS demand source distinction.

**Gate:** unique demand creation under retry; unauthorized/self-approval and confirmed-edit rules pass; all orders trace to buyer reference and product/variant.

### Phase 5 — Inventory ledger, procurement, and MRP

Build inventory posting foundation before purchase/production postings: receipt, status, reservation, availability, issue/return, transfer, count/adjustment, lot/batch, reconciliation, and chosen valuation policy. Implement requisition/approval, optional RFQ, PO, partial receipt, inspection disposition, then time-phased MRP suggestions.

**Gate:** PostgreSQL tests verify migrations, ledger projection rebuild, status eligibility, idempotency, transaction rollback, negative-stock prevention, concurrency, receipt/inspection, reservation, and valuation allocations/reversals. MRP results explain their inputs and never auto-purchase.

### Phase 6 — Planning and work execution

Implement capacity/line/shift plan, production schedule revisions, demand-linked Work Orders, approval/release snapshots, Job Cards, material issue/return/consumption, WIP movements, partial confirmations, downtime, and controlled hold/cancel/close.

**Gate:** operation quantities reconcile under partial output/rework; invalid/repeated transitions are rejected or idempotently replayed; no unaccepted output becomes available stock.

### Phase 7 — Quality and apparel execution

Implement incoming/in-process/inline/end-line/final inspection, defect/disposition, holds/rework/scrap, and apparel cutting/bundle/line/size-color reports where discovery confirms need.

**Gate:** quality disposition controls eligibility; defect/rework flows reconcile and cannot duplicate or loop; customer/style reports trace to transactions.

### Phase 8 — Job work, maintenance, and workforce

Implement supplier custody and job-work dispatch/receipt/reconciliation/charges, maintenance requests/plans/work orders/spares/downtime, and privacy-controlled HR skills/shift/attendance/team references.

**Gate:** supplier-held quantity cannot appear as warehouse-available; custody reconciles; downtime links to schedule; HR permissions tested separately.

### Phase 9 — Finished goods, packing, and dispatch

Implement quality-released finished-goods receipts, variant-aware pick/pack/cartons, dispatch authorization/documents, partial shipment, and delivery confirmation.

**Gate:** PostgreSQL tests prevent dispatch beyond eligible packed stock or remaining Sales Order quantity; each dispatch traces back to shipment, sales line, work order, lot, and inspection.

### Phase 10 — Costing, notifications, reports, and MES

Add cost capture/variance, accounting boundary, in-app/email outbox delivery, operational dashboards/exports, and versioned MES adapters with logs/retry/reconciliation.

**Gate:** calculations are defined and sourced; email/MES outage/retry does not duplicate postings; reports enforce scope; integration contracts and recovery/reconciliation are tested.

### Phase 11 — Production readiness and industry expansion

Complete threat/security review, performance/load tests, migration rehearsal, backups/restore, access reviews, operational monitoring, training/UAT, data migration, and pilot exit criteria. Add shoes or other industry packs only through separate discovery, extension contracts, data mapping, and regression tests.

**Gate:** business owners accept the end-to-end workflow; restore and failure drills pass; supported processes/limitations and operational ownership are explicit.

## 4. Dependency graph

```text
Product/identity/security/local DB
  -> company scope + audit + approvals + UOM/master data
  -> product/style/variant + BOM/routing revisions
  -> buyer PO/Sales Order + demand sources
  -> inventory ledger + procurement receipt/inspection
  -> MRP + capacity schedule
  -> Work Order release + Job Cards + material postings
  -> production confirmation + quality/rework
  -> accepted WIP/finished goods + packing/dispatch
  -> costing, dashboards, email/MES integrations (incrementally wired)
```

Specific ordering constraints:

- Do not build MRP before there are approved product structures and a defined eligible-stock/reservation model.
- Do not post procurement, production, transfer, or dispatch quantities before the shared inventory ledger service exists.
- Do not release a Work Order before BOM/routing snapshot and demand allocation exist.
- Do not treat production confirmation as quality acceptance or finished-goods receipt.
- Do not implement MES write access before normal ERP commands, authorization, idempotency, and reconciliation are stable.
- Build reporting read models from defined source transactions; avoid KPIs from placeholder/sample data.

## 5. Testing and release strategy

For each phase, run domain unit tests, API/application authorization and validation tests, frontend workflow tests, migration tests, and targeted end-to-end tests. Use PostgreSQL—not only SQLite—for production-critical constraints, isolation, locking, numeric handling, and query semantics. Test retries, duplicate requests, stale revisions, wrong-company references, rejection/revision, partial quantities, and rollback.

Apply migrations only through reviewed deployment steps. Keep credentials and realistic customer/employee data out of source control and test fixtures. Release gates include documented operational limits and rollback/forward-recovery steps.

## 6. First implementation slice recommendation

After architecture decisions are reviewed, implement **local backend foundation + authentication login/logout** as a bounded first slice, since this is the explicitly desired development order. Keep the frontend to a minimal authenticated shell only when required to exercise the backend. Do not build access-control administration, sales, manufacturing modules, or install extra packages until the chosen authentication and local database approach requires them.

## 7. Risks and open decisions

- Local PostgreSQL installation and backup/restore ownership.
- OIDC provider versus local-only account/session for first development phase.
- Shoes vs garment target. This roadmap follows the garment/apparel target until the owner confirms a different first industry.
- Company/site/branch scope and data retention.
- Approval matrix, document numbering, currencies, UOM precision and rounding.
- Inventory status, reservations, negative-stock policy, FIFO vs other valuation.
- Shop-floor device/network/offline requirements and MES ownership.
- HR privacy, country-specific payroll/tax/accounting scope.
- Performance/load, availability, RPO/RTO, deployment topology, and operational support.
